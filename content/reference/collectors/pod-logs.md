## Parameters

**selector**: (Required) The selector to use to find matching pods. If this selector returns more than one pod, all matching pods will be collected.

**namespace**: (Optional) The namespace to search for the pod selector in. If this is not provided, it will default to the current namespace of the context.

**limits**: (Optional) Provided to limit the size of the logs. By default, this is set to `maxLines: 10000`. Either `maxAge` or `maxLines` can be provided, but not both.
**limits.maxAge**: The duration of the maximum oldest log to include.
**limits.maxLines**: The number of lines to include, starting from the newest.
